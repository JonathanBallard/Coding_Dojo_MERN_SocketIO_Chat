- User chooses username on client, sends username to server
- Server toasts username
- Client hides <Welcome> and shows <Chat>
- User sends message data through client and <Speak> to server
- Server adds message to list of all messages from all clients
- Client receives array of all messages from server through <Messages>, turns the array of message metadata into a <Message> component
- Client renders <Message> components in an array
